# odin-recipes

This is a very basic HMTL-only recipe website.

The website consists of a main index page which has links to a few 
recipes. The website isn't very pretty, but that is not the point. 

The website is made just to show my HTML chops so far. I will revisit 
this  website in the future to style it up in CSS.
